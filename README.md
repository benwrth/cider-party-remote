# Cider Party Remote
Ever been at a small party or event with music on in the background and there are just a few people who can't seem to stop skipping songs which have been added to queue in favor of their own choice, disregarding everyone else's suggestions?

This plugin is designed to enable and disable some controls of the web remote which can be accessed by anyone on the local network. This makes the remote more versatile as the address can be shared with, for example, people at a party who will be able to add songs to the queue however not do things such as skip songs, change the volume or even quit the app.

Different variations of the remote with varying levels of functionality will be available at different URLs which can be changed or disabled in the plugin's settings interface.

## Cider
[Cider](https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider) is an open source Apple Music client for Windows, MacOS and Linux. I am not affiliated with the Cider Collective in any way.

## Notice
I am new to Cider and this is a very early idea. If I find it isn't possible right now then this repo will probably disappear, so thats how you can tell if its going well!
